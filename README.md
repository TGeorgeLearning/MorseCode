# MorseCode
The project here is quite simple: It utilises your keyboard inputs (Spacebar in this case) and converts it into the signals used in morse code. When you hold down on your spacebar, the console will print out a set of numbers (indicates the time that has passed). One second passing is similar to a dot in morse code, while 3 seconds passing represents a dash. You can use this combination of dots and dashes to create words to string together into sentences!
